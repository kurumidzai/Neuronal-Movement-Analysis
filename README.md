**_Analyze Neuronal Movements_**

This Python script calculates the average and standard deviation of a list of neuronal movement data.


**_Usage_**

To use this script, simply pass a list of movement values as an argument to the `analyze_neuronal_movements()` function. For example:

`movement_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
avg, std_dev = analyze_neuronal_movements(movement_data)
print(avg) # should print 3.0
print(std_dev) # should print 1.5811388300841898`

The function will return the average and standard deviation of the movement data as a tuple.

**_Requirements_**
This script requires Python 3.x to run. No additional libraries are required.

Feel free to use and modify it as needed.
